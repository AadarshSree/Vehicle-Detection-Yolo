# Vehicle-Detection-Yolo
This is a python program running with the aid of the OpenCV library enabling us to detect objects from video and take necessary action. This project was originally created for the automatic detection of vehicles in automobiles through camera input. The algorithm used is the YOLO algorithm with trained weights from the darknet project.
